# companion-module-sequences

## Development
Since this module relies on importing `instance_skel` directly from `companion`, the best way to develop it is to clone this repository into `companion`'s `node_modules` directory.
<!-- -->
This module uses `yarn` instead of `npm`.

## Scripts
- `npm run build`
- `npm run watch`
